  INTRODUCTION

  the pitch.
-->
<p>
  <a href="{{site.swc_site}}">Software Carpentry</a>'s mission
  is to help researchers get more done in less
  time and with less pain by teaching them basic lab skills for
  scientific computing.  This hands-on workshop will cover basic
  concepts and tools, including program design, version control, data
  management, and task automation.  Participants will be encouraged to
  help one another and to apply what they have learned to their own
  research problems.

  ETHERPAD

  At `_misc/etherpad.txt` you will find a template for the etherpad.

  Display the Etherpad for the workshop.  You can set this up in
  advance or on the first day; either way, make sure you push changes
  to GitHub after you have its URL.  To create an Etherpad, go to

      http://pad.software-carpentry.org/YYYY-MM-DD-site

  where 'YYYY-MM-DD-site' is the identifier for your workshop,
  e.g., '2015-06-10-esu'.

<!--
  SYLLABUS

  Show what topics will be covered.

  1. If your workshop is R rather than Python, remove the comment
     around that section and put a comment around the Python section.
  2. Some workshops will delete SQL.
  3. Please make sure the list of topics is synchronized with what you
     intend to teach.
  4. You may need to move the div's with class="col-md-6" around inside
     the div's with class="row" to balance the multi-column layout.

  This is one of the places where people frequently make mistakes, so
  please preview your site before committing, and make sure to run
  'tools/check' as well.
-->

<!--
  SETUP

  Delete irrelevant sections from the setup instructions.  Each
  section is inside a 'div' without any classes to make the beginning
  and end easier to find.

  This is the other place where people frequently make mistakes, so
  please preview your site before committing, and make sure to run
  'tools/check' as well.
-->

<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>

<p>
  The <a href="http://resbaz.cloud.edu.au/ ">ResBaz Cloud</a> will be used during the workshop,
  which means no software needs to be installed proir to attending.
  Participants will need a <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> account
  in order to login to the ResBaz Cloud and to participate in the lessons on version control,
